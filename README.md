# 2024-LiCoO-electrolytes-Li-DFT-Data
This repository contains scripts and computational data used in the preparation of the following article:

Highly Antioxidative Li Salt Enables High-Voltage Ether Electrolyte in Li Metal Battery. DOI: TBD

Please cite this reference if you make use of any parts density-functional theory (DFT) database.

The naming convention for atomic structure files is as follows: ‘+’ and ‘-’ represent the charge state of the species, while ‘()-’ represents an additional electron state.

The dataset contains the following DFT data:

1. Atomic structure in PDB format of DME, Li<sup>+</sup>-DME, 2Li<sup>+</sup>-DME, PFBS<sup>-</sup>, Li<sup>+</sup>-PFBS<sup>-</sup>, 2Li<sup>+</sup>-PFBS<sup>-</sup>, 
TFSI<sup>-</sup>, Li<sup>+</sup>-TFSI<sup>-</sup>, 2Li<sup>+</sup>-TFSI<sup>-</sup>, as depicted in Figure 1. 

2. Atomic structure in PDB format of proposed 1-electron reduced product of DME, Li<sup>+</sup>-DME, 2Li<sup>+</sup>-DME, PFBS<sup>-</sup>, Li<sup>+</sup>-PFBS<sup>-</sup>, 2Li<sup>+</sup>-PFBS<sup>-</sup>, 
TFSI<sup>-</sup>, Li<sup>+</sup>-TFSI<sup>-</sup>, 2Li<sup>+</sup>-TFSI<sup>-</sup>, as depicted in Figure 4. 

3. Atomic structure in FHI-aims format of PFBS<sup>-</sup> and TFSI<sup>-</sup> in vacuum and adsorption configuration on LiCoO<sub>2</sub> $10\overline{1}4$ surface, as well as input file for final single point calculation. 10 random initial configurations were considered, and the most stable configurations were chosen.
